The Council Bot: 

- Can communicate between two different servers and send a message from the source server to the target server
- Has a functioning reaction role feature
- Bot has an open listener to certain words that are said in chat and will respond given a random sequence from an array of positive messages
- Has a silly feature in which if someone were to type, they are sent L for each entry in chat
